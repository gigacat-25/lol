\end{center}

once upon a time the dinosaurs existed on earth and roamed around the world
that too millions of years ago \cite{millions} during that time the world was in chaos as the meteor hit the earth and a huge crater was formed \cite{crater} this led to a massive cloud gathering in the earth which blocked the sun rays for millions of years and almost exterminated the plants and animals \cite{cloud}
